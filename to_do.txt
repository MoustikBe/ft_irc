- You are required to develop an IRC server using the C++ 98 standard.
- You must not develop an IRC client.
- You must not implement server-to-server communication.
- Your executable will be run as follows:
            ./ircserv <port> <password>

- Port: The port number on which your IRC server will be listening for incoming
            IRC connections

- Password: The connection password. It will be needed by any IRC client that tries
            to connect to your server.

- The server must be capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously without
            hanging.

- Forking is prohibited. All I/O operations must be non-blocking
- Only 1 poll() (or equivalent) can be used for handling all these operations (read,
            write, but also listen, and so forth).

-  Several IRC clients exist. You have to choose one of them as a reference. Your
            reference client will be used during the evaluation process
- Your reference client must be able to connect to your server without encountering any error
- Communication between client and server has to be done via TCP/IP (v4 or v6).
- All the messages sent from one client to a channel have to be forwarded to every other client that joined the channel
- You must have operators and regular users.
- Then, you have to implement the commands that are specific to channel operators:
- KICK - Eject a client from the channel
- INVITE - Invite a client to a channel
- TOPIC - Change or view the channel topic
- MODE - Change the channel’s mode: · i: Set/remove Invite-only channel · t: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel operators · k: Set/remove the channel key (password) o: Give/take channel operator privilege · l: Set/remove the user limit to channel


Not done
- You must be able to authenticate, set a nickname, a username, join a channel, send and receive private messages using your reference client.
- Of course, you are expected to write a clean code
- Test example
# BONUS # 
- Handle file transfer.
